# CS224W-Stanford
This is the repository containing the solution of the homework for the Winter 2020 CS224W course at Stanford: Machine Learning with Graphs. Currently, I have only finished with hw0, hw1, hw2. There is still hw3, but I am not able to get round to it, so it is on my TODO list for now!
